# Attribute-emojis-3
There is no attribute-emojis-2, this is when Gungho added a 3rd attribute to the game

## Output directories
* Combined contains plain (solid color) ones
* Combined2 contains the fancy (original asset) ones
* Combined_spritesheets contains prototypes of ones generated from spritesheets of orb skins. These are NOT ready for production, the slices are a bit unaligned, but you can see how they look & then maybe recreate if you like one in particular with individual images cut out from the sheet. idk why they're not aligned if you can figure it out send a pr please.
